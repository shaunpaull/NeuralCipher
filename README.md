# FluidLatticeAI Encryption/Decryption

This repository contains an implementation of an encryption and decryption system using a bio-inspired artificial intelligence model called `FluidLatticeAI`.

## Overview

The `FluidLatticeAI` is a model inspired by biological systems, particularly neural networks and mycelium networks found in fungi. It models a network of nodes that can process information, adapt, and learn in a way that is reminiscent of cells or neurons in a biological system.

In this project, we use the `FluidLatticeAI` to encrypt and decrypt text messages. The `FluidLatticeAI` is trained to predict the encrypted text given the plain text, and vice versa.

## Usage

The main class in this project is the `CistercianCipher` class, which uses the `FluidLatticeAI` for encryption and decryption. Here's a basic example of how to use it:

```cpp
// Create a CistercianCipher object.
CistercianCipher cipher;

// Load the training data.
vector<string> plainText;
vector<string> encryptedText;
loadData("data.txt", plainText, encryptedText); // Assuming you have a function to load data

// Train the CistercianCipher object.
cipher.train(plainText, encryptedText);

// Encrypt some text.
string text = "Hello, world!";
string encryptedText = cipher.encrypt(text);

// Print the encrypted text.
cout << "Encrypted text: " << encryptedText << endl;
